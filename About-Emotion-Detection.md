**AI-Driven Emotion Detection**\n
In todayâ€™s AI-driven world, emotion recognition is a powerful tool used in various applications, from human-computer interaction to mental health monitoring. 
This project focuses on real-time emotion detection using DeepFace and OpenCV, allowing a webcam to analyze facial expressions and determine the dominant emotion.
The system captures frames from a live webcam feed, processes them using DeepFace's pre-trained deep learning models, and overlays the detected emotion on the video display. 
This project showcases the integration of computer vision and deep learning to analyze human emotions in real-time.  
 **Key Objectives:**\n
-Implement real-time emotion detection using a webcam. \n
-Utilize DeepFace for facial emotion analysis. \n
-Leverage OpenCV for video processing and visualization. \n
-Provide an interactive experience for detecting emotions dynamically.  \n
This project can serve as a foundation for AI-powered emotion analysis applications in fields such as customer sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, 
and human-computer interaction.
